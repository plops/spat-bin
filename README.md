point cloud convolution and binning

I tried to simulate the three-dimensional optical transfer function by doing representing the amplitude point spread function as discrete k-vectors. I don't think this is particularly useful calculation method in this case.

My motivation was to understand why for low numerical aperture (NA) lenses the OTF is obtained by convolving two disks (an area), whereas for high NA objectives one convolves two spherical shells (lines).
Unfortunately, I'm still confused about this problem.
